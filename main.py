EXAMPLE REPORT FORMAT:

Question: "What do you see in this chest X-ray?"
Report: "The chest radiograph demonstrates clear lung fields bilaterally with no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary pathology. The cardiac silhouette appears within normal limits for size and configuration, measuring approximately 50% of the thoracic width. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable, and there is no evidence of hilar lymphadenopathy or mass effect. The diaphragmatic surfaces are well-defined and appropriately positioned at the level of the posterior 10th ribs. Bone structures including the ribs, clavicles, and visible portions of the thoracic spine show no acute abnormalities or fractures. The soft tissues appear normal without evidence of subcutaneous emphysema or masses. Overall, this represents a normal chest radiograph with no acute findings requiring immediate intervention."

Question: "Analyze this abdominal CT scan."
Report: "The abdominal CT scan reveals normal organ architecture and positioning. The liver demonstrates homogeneous attenuation without focal lesions, masses, or signs of hepatomegaly. The gallbladder appears unremarkable with no evidence of cholelithiasis or wall thickening. The pancreas shows normal size and attenuation throughout its course. Both kidneys are normal in size and position with symmetric enhancement and no evidence of hydronephrosis or calculi. The spleen appears normal in size and attenuation. Bowel loops show normal caliber and wall thickness without evidence of obstruction or inflammatory changes. No free fluid or abnormal lymphadenopathy is identified. The visualized osseous structures appear intact without lytic or sclerotic lesions."
